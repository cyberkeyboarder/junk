You need to add a PAT (Personal Access Token) instead, 
and you can follow the below method to add a PAT on your system.

    From your GitHub account, go to Settings → Developer Settings → Personal Access Token → Generate New Token (Give your password) → Fillup the form → click Generate token → Copy the generated Token, it will be something like ghp_sFhFsSHhTzMDreGRLjmks4Tzuzgthdvfsrta
